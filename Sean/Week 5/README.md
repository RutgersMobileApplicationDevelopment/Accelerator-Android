## What we did
We reviewed GET requests and vocab from last week as well Maven formatting for dependencies. We started making an app that displays a list of active Rutgers busses using a `RecyclerView`. The `BusApp` folder is the Android Studio project for our bus app. We havent finished the app yet and it isn't functional.

## What we covered
* Review of concepts from last week
* The benefits of `RecyclerView` over `ListView`
* Why we need to use `RecyclerView.Adapter`
* Why we need to use `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`
* An incomplete `RecyclerView` implementation

## Material for Others
* [This article](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) for how to create a `RecyclerView`
