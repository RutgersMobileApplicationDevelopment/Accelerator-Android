## What we did
We learned (at a basic level) how the internet works and how to interact with APIs over the internet with Java. We made an Android app that displays the bio of a GitHub user when you give it a GitHub username. The completed source code for the project is in the `/GitHubApp` folder.

## What we covered
* What a web API request is
* The differences between GET and POST
* Some vocabulary terms:
    - Base url
    - Endpoint
    - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    - POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
    - Data class (AKA Javabean)
    - Serialization (converting to JSON)
    - Deserialization (converting from JSON)
* Using Retrofit with Gson to make network requests
* What "asychronous" means

## Material for Others
